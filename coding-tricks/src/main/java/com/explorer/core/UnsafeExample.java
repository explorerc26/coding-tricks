 * You can;
 * 
 * Create an object without calling a constructor.
 * Throw any exception even Exception without worrying about throws clauses on methods. (There are other way to do this I know)
 * Get/set randomly accessed fields in an object without using reflection.
 * allocate/free/copy/resize a block of memory which can be long (64-bit) in size.
 * Obtain the location of fields in an object or static fields in a class.
 * independently lock and unlock an object lock. (like synchronize without a block)
 * define a class from provided byte codes. Rather than the classloader determining what the byte code should be. (You can do this with reflection as well)
